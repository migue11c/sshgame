// LOGIC

// DATA
Refactor getPoi() to make a 3 dimensional data vector.
Refactor Poi rendering to look for points of interest in their respective sectors.
Also add 2 points of reference. Starting and selected.

// VECTOR RENDER
Implement render.cpp directly into /include and resolve duplicate functions
After implementing render.cpp:
    - Change map render data directory
    - Use PlayerData for:
        - Camera anchor
        - Initializing camera
        - Hidden nodes
